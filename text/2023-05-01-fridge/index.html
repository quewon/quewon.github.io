<hr><p>it's been a decade since she left. since i checked my fridge. it's broken and warm. it's tearing at the seams and i can see mold, see fruits half-submerged in water, and i can't actually tell if they've gone bad or not. i can't smell them. i'm uninterested in disturbing them. i'm uninterested in peeling them back to see if they've rotted inside. because then i might see the skin of it was a lie, that it had turned black inside. then i might have to face the fact that everything she left me was biodegradable.</p>
