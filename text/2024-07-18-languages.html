    <p>the way i experience life is heavily informed by the languages i know. the language of games, the language of film and tv, words itself... this framework makes life bearable at worst and fruitful at best, to me. less daunting. but i wonder how i would have lived if i never adopted these languages. if i was never taught to see beauty would i have found it on my own?</p>

    <p>sometimes it wears me out, to be so limited by the languages i know.</p>
