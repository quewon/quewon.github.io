<p>i redesigned this website! using <a href="https://www.11ty.dev" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">11ty</a>, which is my first static site generator. i'm kind of in love.</p>
<p>in my visual design i'm extremely minimal at heart. the first theme i made for my tumblr blog in 2012 or something was a lot of negative space, teeny-tiny text, black on white.</p>
<p>as my interests broaden to cover analog and physical material,</p>
<p>today i had a fun trawl through the websites showcased by <a href="https://cargo.site/company-writing/sites-in-use" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cargo</a> and found countless websites</p>
<p>visual design is extremely functional. i've been looking at various portfolio websites</p>

<p>i tend to understate myself. it's something that i do when i introduce myself in person, when i show off something i've worked on, and when i design websites for myself. often i think it's cool to be understated, because i like to take care to the overlooked, and i aspire to think about the things that i love more than i think about selling myself.</p>
