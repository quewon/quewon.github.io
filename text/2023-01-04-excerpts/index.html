        i can't stop thinking about that movie. the main character was a girl that was so naive that she helped hide the murder of her friend, and she was incapable of communicating her grief in a way that didn't come off as heartless, and she ended up getting killed by those who thought they were being righteous. the movie made her seem like she was so helpless that she was incapable of being good. her life just got worse and worse and nobody cared to do anything about it. nobody loved her.

        its weird that people say that stories become more universal the more specific they are. and that cartoons and fables, in its super abstracted form, can sometimes be more relatable and memorable than dry realistic media. and that the uncanny valley exists. it's like, are the best stories the ones that view the world through a tiny pinhole where you see such a small part of the picture that your brain is forced to make sense of it in a way that connects most to you?

        I don't know if all programmers feel this way, but sometimes, when I've been coding for days straight and the world is quiet and there's nothing on my mind except for developing this program, I feel a distant sadness. Not the kind of <i>sad</i> that's depressing or impactful. It's like the echo of a long lost memory. Like I'm remembering a promise I forgot I made decades ago. Except there's no actual memory attached to it, just the vague feeling of childhood and sadness.

        i don't really talk to the other students. they don't really talk to me. i've got nothing to say to them, except when we're doing group assignments and i put on my polite face and go with the flow of ideas. this is familiar to me, conversations of theory and presentations. when i was little, mom would sometimes run things by me first. presentations, briefs, pitches that she had to make. "if it makes sense to a kid like you," she would say, "it'll make sense to those guys that know nothing about rockets."<br>
        but relationships made within group projects only last as long as the project does.<br><br>
        dr. adamu,<br>
        my name is Eunoo Lee. i'm the son of Dr. <br><br>
        Thanks so much for the in-depth critique. It really helped me figure out where to go from here. Your point about the main character's voice disappearing in the middle is particularly memorable. I originally wrote those scenes so minimally because I wanted them to feel sort of numb and sparse, like the character isn't even really there themselves, but I figure my approach doesn't really work here. <br><br>
        &gt; It makes it sound like the meat of the story has been the MC struggling to emotionally cope with integrating on earth and making it a new home, which none of the previous scenes actually deal with.<br><br>
        Ahh yeah, that's it, isn't it?<br><br>
        I'm hesitant to break away from these scenes about mundane life (school, public transportation, secretaries, drunk guardians) because I want the story to feel grounded and showcase the small everyday stresses that stack up for the main character, but the more I think about it, the more I realize there's a lot this concept has to offer alongside it. I think the way to go is to talk about the main character's interpretation of the more dramatic aspects, things like political discourse and the state of the world post-moonquake.<br><br>
        I also just realized that I don't answer a lot of questions and leave a lot of loose threads because I think that's "realistic", but the main character internally resolves that frustration too quickly for it to work well.
