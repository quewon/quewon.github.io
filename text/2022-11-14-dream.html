        i speak french to this woman on the elevator that i see every once in a while<br>
        she speaks french back and im like a non je ne parle francais but she starts speaking rapid french and i pick up some words and manage to have a conversation with her<br>
        she employs me . im sort of pressured into it. i get a brain chip or something that can track my every move. but im like a computer genius in this world im something she wants to keep so i leave my family and my girlfriend and work. the work is fulfilling. i never leave the compound that the french woman provided me.

        meanwhile people have been looking for me. apparently they can track my heartbeat and theyre especially worried when my heartbeat shoots up to like 220 bpm after i realize that i cant go home and that i can never see my family again<br>
        i sneak back home . i barely say a word to anyone out of fear that my handlers are listening. i barely look at my girlfriend. somebody hands me a packet of stickers. i write on the back : wish youd given me a photo of (her name) instead. i look out the window. they're approaching the apartment building. i have to go, i think i say for the first time in a low voice, im sorry. i have to go.<br>
        i dont tell them why. i leave immediately. i make my way down the stairs because im afraid using the elevators will reveal where my family is. ??? and i run into them
