<p>&quot;is this thing even gonna fly?&quot;</p>
<p>in my cheap phone screen, your expression is usually pixelated beyond the point of recognition, but right now it's clearly <em>dubious</em>. makes me laugh as i move to grab another wet wipe. there's more grime on the inside of the ship.</p>
<p>&quot;it's a good model, sturdy,&quot; i explain, &quot;i think the owner just didn't take good care of it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;dude, you should just saved your money and gotten a new one.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;and miss another new year's with you?&quot;</p>
<p>today is new year's eve. the ship arrived just in time thanks to express shipping. it's a small, cheap pl△stic thing with scratched up windows and uneven grooves, but the seller posted a stargazing video with it up in space, small lightbulbs lining the walls blue and mid 2010's pop playing through tinny speakers and it was perfect, i had to get my hands on it.</p>
<p>you're a world away and we still call through the int◯rnet. your microphone is ancient and sometimes you have to yell to be heard. i imagine the sounds i can't hear, the quiet sighs and muttering under your breath. in my dreams you're in high definition, and i can zoom into your face so far i can see pores and individual strands of hair.</p>
<p>you roll your eyes. &quot;you should have just booked a fl□ght.&quot;</p>
<p>i grin into the camera. &quot;and miss exploring d△rk space with you?&quot;</p>
<p>we talk til the sun rises. for me—your side of the screen slowly goes dark as your sun sets. we talk about exam season (&quot;i am definitely not signing up for another one of that professor's classes.&quot;), we talk about our childhood. after we moved apart, we used to plan to meet every season, but we never had enough money for the trip. this time i don't have any plans. i just want to cross the sky with you.</p>
<p>mostly, i miss space.</p>
