        i went to the theatre with my friend<br>
        we booked a ticket for a movie with no name and<br>
        when we went inside it was a black screen for 2 hours<br>
        all i heard was the sound of music<br>
        my friend turned to me and said,<br>
        oh, i’ve heard this on the radio before
    </p>

    <p>
        i picked up a deck of cards from a magician<br>
        to play a game that my grandmother taught me<br>
        i couldn’t remember the rules, so i started laying them out<br>
        but the cards were all blank<br>
        and i couldn't play
    </p>
    
    <p>
        oh everything i cannot see<br>
        oh everything i cannot hear<br>
        i tried a game that i could not win<br>
        lived a story i could not tell
