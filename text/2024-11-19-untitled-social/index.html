    <h1>hi. welcome to untitled social :)</h1>
<p>below is a little background about the creation of this website</p>
<p>(post break)</p>
<p>i made this over the course of about a month, based on conversations i've had with adam about social media.</p>

            <p></p>
<p>i got the idea for the name from that burger spot &quot;untitled burger&quot;. i like how it makes this website sound like it's barely a social media. that's exactly what it is: barebones.</p>
<h1>what is &quot;untitled social&quot; for?</h1>
<p>i like hanging out with my friends (you guys) in real life. i also still really like social media, even though i'm pretty disillusioned by most social media these days. i like the conversation, that it can be a place to put random noncommittal thoughts or a shared memory archive.</p>
<p>i was into cohost for a while, which was a social media that was intentionally designed to not show numbers—likes, follower counts, etc—which made it feel like old forums i used to frequent online, quiet and maybe even a bit unengaging. but in the end, more human for it. unfortunately, cohost shut down recently, so that left me wanting.</p>
<p>adam had the idea that this website shouldn't replace but <em>facilitate</em> our offline interaction. so i think it would be nice to use this website to...</p>
<ul>
<li>post photos after a hangout</li>
<li>share an article you want to talk about later</li>
<li>record the wins and losses of a board game sesh</li>
<li>review a movie after movie night</li>
<li>share lyrics or musical ideas to jam to later</li>
<li>summarize or reflect on a good conversation</li>
<li>post details for an upcoming event that might be interested in</li>
<li>share art</li>
</ul>
<p>or post random things. part of the reason i made this website is because i hate scrolling through twitter slop but i don't have anything better to aimlessly scroll when i'm on the toilet :)</p>
<p>anyway, i had a lot of fun making this. hope you can have fun with it as well!</p>
