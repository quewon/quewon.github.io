        last night i was lost on the shores of a city too big and vast for me to know and met a young solo sea captain. she was friendly, showed me around her living ship. the whole time, i was secretly hoping she would ask me to join her. i knew that i'd drop everything to be a part of this world. i pulled some stunts trying to impress her, provoking the fish people at the bottom of the ocean and rushing upwards to drive them to the surface.

        when the sun was setting and i laid there, drenched and out of breath and feeling stupid on the shore, the captain appeared above me and smiled. she asked me if i wanted to join her. i said yes, absolutely. she asked me if my parents would be ok with that, if i could quit school for this. i told her everything would work out.
