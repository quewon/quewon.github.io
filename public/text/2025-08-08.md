it's been a hectic week. i've been attending the 42 piscine! i've gotten a bit invested in it, and for a moment i forgot it wasn't my goal. until i was standing in line to take my first exam and i realized i wasn't nervous at all. it's nice to be talking to people, to be in a friendly (and somewhat competitive) environment.

it feels like a drug, to be so energized by simply having a strict and defined goal. i don't think i want to live this way forever. is what i want a slow growth? many invigorating and rewarding times in my life were when i had a strict defined goal and i pushed myself to change. i think i want a good sustainable rhythm that i could ride forever. if i learned to live that way maybe i would be unstoppable.
