![A page in a notebook. There's a drawing of a birthday cake with a candle shaped like the number 20. Underneath, scrawled in all caps, reads: 'I'M REALLY GOOD AT BEING ALIVE, I'M GOING TO VERIFY IT IN A COMPETITION, AND I'LL WIN THE FIRST PLACE PRIZE (IMMORTALITY) BECAUSE I'M BETTER AT IT THAN EVERYBODY ELSE. EXISTENCE IS A CONTEST. I'M COMPETITIVE. THIS IS THE ONLY THING I'VE GOT GOING FOR ME LET ME PROVE IT TO YOU. THIS IS ALL I HAVE. PLEASE.'](IMG_5729.jpeg)
