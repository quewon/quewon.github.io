yesterday i went to the paris html energy event in parc des buttes-chaumont. it was a lot of fun. i felt the familiar tension of meeting strangers, but all of these strangers felt familiar too, a bunch of html nerds. i made a [website](https://quewon.github.io/html-day-2025/). i'm inspired to make better websites. i'm inspired to make better things. i walked and talked with ossama for a long time after the event. it was nice to talk at length like we used to do. i feel much more settled these days.
