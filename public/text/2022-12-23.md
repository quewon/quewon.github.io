baby get in my truck, it's magic and i hold it in the inside of my heart. when cars speed across the highway i feel it rumble and resonate. road trips are easy when you have a car in your body, it's pick up and go. when i travel through tunnels echoing white and blue i sometimes imagine i'm falling through a hole til my stomach drops. it goes where no other truck dares to take youâ€”it'll bring you home.
