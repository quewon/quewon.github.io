today was a good day. i went outside. i bought some groceries. i wrote an email. i watched a movie. i finally sent a message to the translation people to let them know that i'm no longer interested in doing translation work. i played with the cat. i ate a burger for lunch. i had a small, sweet interaction with a stranger online. i introduced e and k to each other, two good friends of mine with lots of overlapping interests and experience, and the three of us might make a game together in september.
