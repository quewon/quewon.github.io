im turning over in my sleep  
youre turning to look at me  
i told my mom when she called  
“im turning over a new leaf”

youre turning into my ex  
im trying to work myself up to having sex  
we air ourselves out to dry  
im getting closer and closer but not quite

im doing shit and complaining  
im turning little things into the world and youre straining  
im turning on you my love  
you still dont turn down my trust

still i dont owe you so much  
can’t be in debt to a friend that i know and love  
still i turn on my love  
still i turn on my love
