today i set up my obsidian workspace. i also installed an app that makes my keyboard make sounds when i type. as i write i have that going along with some rain noise. it's nice to have noise in my ears as i write. it's nice to block out the sounds of the world. maybe in the future i'll get noise cancelling headphones.

<template>i've been thinking about writing again. i've been thinking about a lot of things but have been unable to act on them. i think there's probably a way to do things more productively. i've spent a lot of time in my life wanting to do things but not being able to. here are some things that i want to do:

- play guitar
- write
- write a story
- write a poem
- make a game
- make a narrative game
- make a multiplayer game
- make a toy
- make a physical machine
- do something good for the world
- make something that goes viral
- study art
- do research (in what?)

i think there is a way to tackle these things methodically. it also doesn't help that i have so much noise in my head. there is something slowing down my thinking and my ability to do things. maybe it's ok though. i don't think it's healthy to aspire to be the most productive person ever. but i think i do want to be skilled. i want to be efficient and masterful. and i think all of these things that i listed are things that i feel that i have a chance of mastering. or rather, really enjoying the process of mastering.</template>
