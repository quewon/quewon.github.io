i made a decision about whether or not i wanted to go with this startup today. i think i'm desperate to get a job, to stop being financially dependent on those around me, but i think i need to pursue a job that pays me fairly and sustainably. i feel good about this decision. it feels grounded. i've been fortunate to have friends and family and connections that are so understanding.
