promising, at 3am in a bar with a friend, that "i'm going to have everything figured out by the time i'm thirty." but i'm already going on twenty-two, and my parents are in their fifties, and it's plain to see that they haven't figured everything out. maybe i'll manage itâ€”maybe i'll be the singular, total scholar of my own mind, body, and soul. i once watched a video by a philosopher who was a hundred years old, who was still scared to die, who had been thinking about this shit his whole life and still hadn't come up with a satisfying conclusion. i'm getting something wrong about life, but i can't really figure out what that is. it seems nobody can. it seems everybody, even the existential philosopher, is too busy living.
