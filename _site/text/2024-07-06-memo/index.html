<hr><p>screenshot of a memo on the iphone notes app, last edited july 1st, 2024 at 8:09 PM. the first paragraph reads: &quot;hmm a social media... interaction like a radio—passive—but somehow active, as a game?&quot; the second paragraph reads: &quot;tap once—tap twice—tap thrice&quot;. third paragraph: &quot;the purpose of a system is what it does&quot; fourth paragraph: &quot;i want to make you feel special and loved&quot; last paragraph: &quot;but why is it that i only ever fail and act selfishly&quot;</p>
