it’s 5am. you are so, so thirsty. there’s no water in your house. the taps aren’t working. no stores are open at this hour. you must scavenge for anything to quench your thirst. you find humidity in the nooks and crannies of your apartment. you find mold and grease. you find sap from your houseplant. you find sweat. you find a little fairy in the bottom of your sink. you find fae hiding in your cabinets and underneath your bed and in your hair. they show you honey and wine. they make you swim. they pull your head under the syrup and you hold your breath.

you count to ten and pull your head out of the bathtub. it’s 9am. you feel tired, like you want to go home.
